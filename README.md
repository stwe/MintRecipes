# Linux Mint Post Install Scripts

Automates things I do after installing Linux.

Among other things, the following will be installed: Chrome, CLion, IDEA Community, Code, a WhatsAppClient, VLC and much more.

A new wallpaper is set, [Kora](https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1256209/) as icon theme and [WhiteSur-Dark](https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1403328/) as global theme.
